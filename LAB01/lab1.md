I think python is very similar to english , that means its so simple no need so much of coding acutualy , I don’t have to declare variable types and this is my first time learning it, i think its moslty differnett to C++ Also, using == to compare strings surprised me because it works directly in Python. Sometimes Python gave an error just because of one space , that is something that made me erros for exmaple, If I miss 1 space, Python give error. Writing loops and if-statements felt easier than in C++ I feel that python can be learnt easliy than any other languages and so that is a good thing and this and It feels more simple. But in C++ I have to plan more and use correct syntax or it give error.
