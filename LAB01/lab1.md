Since I'm studying Python for the first time, I believe it differs most from C++. Python is quite comparable to English, which means it's really straightforward and doesn't need a lot of actual writing. I also don't have to specify variable types. I was also taken aback by the fact that == compares strings directly in Python. One space can occasionally cause Python to provide an error, which is what caused me to make mistakes. For instance, Python will give an error if I miss one space. Python can be learned more easily than any other language, which is a positive thing. Writing loops and if-statements seemed easier than in C++.
